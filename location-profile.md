# Configuring Location Profiles

## 1. Introduction

You've now configured everything required to perform a local snapshot of a Kubernetes application using Kasten - *but snapshots are not backup!* In order to restore in the event the local cluster or primary storage is compromised, a copy of that data should be exported to another location.

The configuration of these backup targets are called ***Location Profiles***. Kasten [supports several options](https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/configuration.html), including:
  - AWS S3
  - Azure Blob
  - Google Cloud Storage
  - S3-Compatible
  - NFS
  - Veeam Backup & Recovery

Kasten supports the creation of immutable backups to ensure that, as a last line of defense against ransomware, backup data cannot be manipulated or deleted by any user. These backups are supported on the following platforms:
  - AWS S3
  - S3-Compatible with Object Lock support (ex. Ceph, MinIO, Wasabi, etc.)
  - Azure Blob

---

*In this exercise, you will configure an immutable bucket using the on-cluster Ceph Object Gateway deployment and add the bucket as a Location Profile in Kasten.*

> [!CAUTION]
>
> In a real world environment you should never back up data to the same infrastructure you are intending to protect - using on-cluster storage as a backup target is performed in the lab solely to simplify lab staging and instructions. 

## 2. Configuring Immutable Ceph Object Gateway Bucket

1. In your local terminal, connect to the environment using your ***Red Hat Demo Platform*** environment details:

    ```bash
    ssh lab-user@YOUR-LAB-IP-OR-FQDN
    ```

1. From the `[lab-user@hypervisor ~]$` prompt, connect to your bastion host for CLI access:

    ```bash
    sudo ssh root@192.168.123.100
    ```

1. From the `[root@ocp4-bastion ~]#` prompt, create an externally accessible Route for the ODF `rook-ceph-rgw-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstore` Service:

    ```bash
    cat <<EOF | oc create -f - 
    kind: Route
    apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
    metadata:
      name: s3-route
      namespace: openshift-storage
    spec:
      to:
        kind: Service
        name: rook-ceph-rgw-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstore
      tls:
        termination: reencrypt
        insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
      port:
        targetPort: https
    EOF

    export CEPH_S3_ENDPOINT="https://$(oc get route \
      s3-route -n openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
    ```

1. Install the `aws` CLI tool:

    ```bash
    curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
    unzip awscliv2.zip
    sudo ./aws/install
    ```

1. Configure S3 credentials:

    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(oc get secret \
      rook-ceph-object-user-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstore-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstoreuser \
      -n openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{.data.AccessKey}' | base64 --decode)

    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(oc get secret \
      rook-ceph-object-user-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstore-ocs-storagecluster-cephobjectstoreuser \
      -n openshift-storage -o jsonpath='{.data.SecretKey}' | base64 --decode)
    ```

1. Create `kasten` Bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled and configure the default object retention policy:

    ```bash
    aws --endpoint=${CEPH_S3_ENDPOINT} s3api create-bucket \
      --bucket kasten --object-lock-enabled-for-bucket

    aws --endpoint=${CEPH_S3_ENDPOINT} s3api put-object-lock-configuration \
      --bucket kasten \
      --object-lock-configuration '{ "ObjectLockEnabled": "Enabled", "Rule": { "DefaultRetention": { "Mode": "COMPLIANCE", "Days": 5 }}}'
    ```

1. Save the values that will be used to configure your Location Profile in the next section:

    ```bash
    printf '%s\n' 'ACCESS KEY:' ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID} 'SECRET KEY:' ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} 'ENDPOINT:' ${CEPH_S3_ENDPOINT}
    ```

## 3. Creating an S3-Compatible Location Profile

1. In the ***Kasten Dashboard***, select ***Profiles â†’ Location*** from the sidebar and click ***+ New Profile***.

1. Fill out the following fields ***but DO NOT click Save Profile yet***:

    |  |  |
    |---|---|
    | ***Profile Name*** | `ceph-rgw-immutable` |
    | ***Storage Provider*** | S3 Compatible |
    | ***S3 Access Key*** | Paste `ACCESS KEY` value |
    | ***S3 Secret*** | Paste `SECRET KEY` value |
    | ***Endpoint*** | Paste `ENDPOINT` value |
    | ***Region*** | `us-east-1` |
    | ***Bucket*** | `kasten` |

    ![](static/location-profile/02.png)

1. Select ***Enable Immutable Backups*** and click the ***Validate Bucket*** button.

    ![](static/location-profile/03.png)

    You should expect for all checks to pass, as shown. If you encounter errors, verify your ***Endpoint***, ***Access***, ***Secret***, and ***Bucket*** values are correct before attempting to validate again.

1. Drag the ***Protection Period*** slider to set how far into the past you want to be able to access immutable backups data.

1. Click ***Save Profile***.

    You should expect your `ceph-rgw-immutable` Location Profile to appear as ***Valid***.

    Now you're ready to start protecting apps!

1. Click the ***< / > yaml*** button to view the YAML generated by creating a Location Profile through the Dashboard.

    ![](static/location-profile/06.png)

    As you can see from this example, Kasten Location Profiles can be created declaratively as a `profile.config.kio.kasten.io` object referencing a Secret to store access and secret keys. This Kubernetes-native implementation makes it simple to configure backup targets using a GitOps approach.
